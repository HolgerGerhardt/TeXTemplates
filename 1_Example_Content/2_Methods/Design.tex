\label{sec:Methods}

In this section, we first present the design of the experiment (\ref{sec:design}) and derive behavioral predictions (\ref{sec:Predictions}).

Let's test the euro symbol: \euro 1,234.56. Let's also test text superscripts: $i$\textsuperscript{th} and text subscripts: CO\textsubscript{2} and H\textsubscript{2}O.

Let's test the footnote settings.\footnote{\blindmathfalse\blindtext\blindmathtrue}

\autoref{fig:screenshot:BS_inc_half} shows an~exemplary decision screen with $B=\euro 11$ and $r\approx15\%$ for both \balA (upper panel) and \unbalA[8] (lower panel). Through a~slider, subjects choose their preferred ${x \in \CS[X]}$.\footnote{The slider had no initial position---it appeared only after subjects first positioned the mouse cursor over the slider bar. This was done to avoid default effects.} The slider position in Figure \ref{fig:screenshot:BS_inc_half} indicates ${x = 0.5}$, i.e., the earliest payment is reduced by \euro 5.50. Since ${r \approx 15\%}$ in this example, this slider position amounts to \euro 6.30 that are paid at later payment dates. While these \euro 6.30 are paid in a~single bank transfer on the latest payment date in \balA, the amount is dispersed in equal parts over the last 8~payment dates in \unbalA[8]---i.e., 8~consecutive payments of \euro 0.79.\footnote{We always rounded the second decimal place up so that the sum of the payments included in a~dispersed payoff was always at least as great as the respective concentrated payoff.}
