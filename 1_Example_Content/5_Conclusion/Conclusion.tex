\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

Cite some more papers \citep{Yaari1965, Warner2001, Davidoff2005, Benartzi2011}. Let's cite a~book: \cite{Luce1959}. Let's cite a~contribution to a~collected volume: \cite{Harrison2008} and a~collection (an~edited volume) itself: \cite{Kagel2016}. Now let's cite presentations at conferences: \cite{Beute2012, Vosgerau2008}. \cite{Attema2016} propose a~method for ``measuring discounting without measuring utility''\footnote{The basic idea of their method is intriguingly simple: Imagine an~individual who is indifferent between, say, Option~A: \$10 today and Option~B: \$10 in one year plus \$10 in two years. With a~constant annual discount factor $\delta$, this indifference translates to $u(\$10) = \delta\,u(\$10) + \delta^2\,u(\$10)$, so that $u(\$10)$ cancels out, and $\delta$ can be readily calculated as the solution to $1 = {\delta + \delta^2}$.}.
