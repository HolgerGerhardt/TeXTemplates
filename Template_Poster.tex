\begin{block}{Introduction}
\vspace{-0.333333\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Temporal discounting is key concept in economics.
	\item Normative model: exponential discounting, but observed decisions are hard to explain \citep[e.g.,][]{Dohmen2012}.
	\item The composition of latex and of typical rubbers is given below. Math test: $\mathbfit{\chi} \in \mathbfit{X}$, $\sigma_\epsilon, c^\alpha$.
	\item The trees are regularly tapped and the coagulated latex which exudes is collected and worked up into rubber \citep{Koszegi2013}.
	\item There is no feasible method at present known of preventing the inclusion of the resin of the latex with the rubber during coagulation.
	\item Although the separation of the resin from the solid caoutchouc by means of solvents is possible, it is not practicable or profitable commercially.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Design of the Study {\mdseries(Box 1)}}
\vspace{-0.333333\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The latex of the best rubber plants furnishes from 20\% to 50\% of rubber.
	\item As the removal of the impurities of the latex is one of the essential points to be aimed at, it was thought that the use of a centrifugal machine to separate the caoutchouc as a cream from the watery part of the latex would prove to be a satisfactory process.
	\item The watery portion of the latex soaks into the trunk, and the soft spongy rubber which remains is kneaded and pressed into lumps or balls: \\[0.333333\baselineskip]
	\highlight{\balA, \balB:} Each payment transferred on single day. \\[0.333333\baselineskip]
	\highlight{\unbalA:} Earlier payoff concentrated, while later payoff dispersed over ${n = 2}$, 4, or 8~dates. \\[0.333333\baselineskip]

\vspace{-0.333333\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize} \justifying
	\item[\mynum{1}] As a secondary function we may recognize the power of closing wounds, which results from the rapid coagulation of exuded latex in contact with the air.
	\item[\mynum{2}] In some cases (Allium, Convolvulaceae, etc.) rows of cells with latex-like contents occur, but the walls separating the individual cells do not break down.
	\item[\mynum{3}] The rows of cells from which the laticiferous vessels are formed can be distinguished (6.3~p.p. vs. 2.6~p.p.; ${p < 0.01}$).

\begin{block}{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.333333\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The latex exhibits a neutral, acid, or alkaline reaction, depending on the plant from which it was obtained.
	\item The latex is therefore usually allowed to coagulate on the tree \citep{Koszegi2013}.
	\item See \cite{Bordalo2013, Dohmen2012}.
	\item The latex, which is usually coagulated by standing or by heating, is obtained from incisions.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  COLUMN 2  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{textblock*}{\colwidth}(\leftmargin+\colwidth+\colsep, \blockFour)

\begin{block}{~}
\vspace{-0.333333\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
	\item When exposed to air, the latex gradually undergoes putrefactive changes accompanied by coagulation.
	\item The addition of a small quantity of ammonia or of formalin to some latices has the effect of preserving them.
	\item There is, however, reason to believe the following.
	\item The coagulation of latex into rubber is not mainly of this character.
