\chapter{Acknowledgements}

%I would like to thank Holger Gerhardt for TeXnical assistance.

I blame all of you. Writing this book has been an exercise in sustained suffering. The casual reader may, perhaps, exempt herself from excessive guilt, but for those of you who have played the larger role in prolonging my agonies with your encouragement and support, well \dots\ you know who you are, and you owe me.%
