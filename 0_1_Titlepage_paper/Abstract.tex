This is where the abstract of your paper goes. The abstract is an~extremely brief summary of your paper and basically follows the same structure as the paper itself: background/motivation of your study, methods, results, discussion/conclusion. Each section, however, is covered in a~single sentence or maybe two sentences instead of an~entire section. \blindtext
