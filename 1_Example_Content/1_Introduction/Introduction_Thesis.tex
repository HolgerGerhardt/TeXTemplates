``Most people can save a~few dollars a~day or even \$10 a~day,'' she said. ``That’s doable.

\blindtext

Let us cite some publications: \cite{Andersen2008, Andreoni2012, Balakrishnan2016, Koszegi2013}. With the options set for BibLaTeX in the preamble, citations in the body text are automatically sorted chronologically---irrespective of the order of the ``citekeys'' in your input. Of course, entries are sorted alphabetically by author surname in the list of references.

Some more references: See \cite{Sims2003, Gabaix2014} for models of ``rational inattention'' or ``goal-driven attention.'' See \cite{Bordalo2012, Bordalo2013, Koszegi2013, Taubinsky2014, Bushong2016} for models of ``stimulus-driven attention.'' Let's also reference some tables: \autoref{tab:basic_formatting} and \autoref{tab:advanced_formatting}.
