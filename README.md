# TeXTemplates
## General Information
This repository includes templates for
* manuscripts to be submitted to academic journals,
* dissertations,
* master’s or bachelor’s theses,
* term papers,
* presentation slides, and
* conference posters.
## Noteworthy Features
* The templates for longform texts (dissertations, article manuscripts, theses, term papers) attempt to typeset the body text such that it adheres to a baseline grid.
* Support for context-based typesetting of mathematical formulas: Formulas in a serif-font environment are typeset using the serif font, while formulas in a sansserif-font environment are typeset using the sansserif font.
* Most templates use [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) with [`biber`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biber) as the backend. (For reasons why to use [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) with [`biber`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biber) instead of [`natbib`](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib) with [`bibtex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex), see [this post on StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib/25702#25702).)
