# TeXTemplates


## General Information

This repository includes templates for

* manuscripts to be submitted to academic journals,
* dissertations,
* bachelor’s/master’s theses and term papers,
* presentation slides,
* conference posters, and
* (academic) curricula vitae/résumés.


## Noteworthy Features

* The templates for long-form texts (dissertations, article manuscripts, theses, term papers) attempt to typeset the body text such that it adheres to a baseline grid.

* Support for context-based typesetting of mathematical formulas: Formulas in a serif-font environment are typeset using the serif font, while formulas in a sansserif-font environment are typeset using the sansserif font.

* All templates use [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) with [`biber`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biber) as the backend. (For reasons why to use [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) with [`biber`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biber) instead of [`natbib`](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib) with [`bibtex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex), see [this post on StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib/25702#25702).)
